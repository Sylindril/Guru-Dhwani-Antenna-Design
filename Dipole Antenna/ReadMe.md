### Dipoles, Dipoles everywhere

Dipole simulations, CAD drawings
The dipole antenna is a wonderful tool to understand the nitty-gritty of antenna simulation. 
I've oncluded my simulations for these antennas under various conditions, and will be updating this folder as we generate new documents during its' construction.
THis serves as a precursro to the simulation (done) and construction of the LPDA
