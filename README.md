# Guru-Dhwani-Antenna-Design
I realised that I've left my github completely unutilized, and as a result don't really have anything to show when people ask me about my github.
Furthermore, after a few hard drives going corrupt I've re-evaluated my approach towards storing everything locally and not worrying about it, and am now actively uploading
whatever I can salvage  - Here I've included some of the .NEC models (that I could find) that I created or modified while preparing for the Guru Dhwani Antenna Design Challenge -
If anything appears incomplete, it probably is and I couldn't find the most up-to-date version of it.
